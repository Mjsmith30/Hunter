## Getting Started
*In order to get started you will need to be logged in with your google account. Once you are logged in you can begin posting items to sale. If maybe youre only interested in viewing items for sale are are looking for something in particular you can browse the items we have a contact a seller via email or phone number whichever they choose to provide.*

*My next step will be adding a search bar that will shift throught all of the items that I have for sale by keyword and return that object. Therefore providing a much easier route to finding items you are particularly interested in.*
